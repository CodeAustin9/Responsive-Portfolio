          Originally from the midwest, I was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan. I've lived and taught in Colorado for the past eighteen years.
          My undergraduate degree was in Education and Humanities. After twenty years in education, I chose a new path - a path that lead me towards engineering and technology.
        </p>

        <p>
          My new path began eight years ago. A concern of mine
          has always been the environment, and more specifically, climate change and human effects on the top of our land
          food chain, the polar bear. I traveled to Churchill, Canada, to get a first hand look at human impact on the polar bear
          habitat. What I saw was alarming, no ice and wintry landscape when these conditions should have been present. I
          spoke with biologists at the Polar Bear Research facility about an idea I had to help the polar bears, but my idea
          was met with speculation. This is when I decided that I would go back to school to become an engineer to try to
          build my prototype, but would need a lot of coursework and background to accomplish this goal in the meantime.
        </p>
        <p>
          Still deciding what specific engineering degree I want to pursue to build to help build my prototype, I decided
          to enroll in the University of Denver Bootcamp to figure out if I could somehow incorporate programming skills in with engineering.
          In addition to bootcamp, I am pursuing prerequisites in engineering, taking Calculus 3 and Intro to Python Programming at night.
          I plan to gain employment in the web development and design field prior to, or while attending Colorado School of Mines,
          either full time or part time, beginning in August 2018.
